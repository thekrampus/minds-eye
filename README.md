A horse. A weed. And a figment of my mind's eye.
================================================


Synopsis for the unaware - in the Uhh Yeah Dude (UYD) podcasts, hosts Seth Romatelli and Jonathan Laroquette banter back and forth about current events and from time to time dip into a game of Seth's own invention: Seth will pitch Jah three phrases, and Jah must identify which phrase is the name of a prize-winning race horse, which is a strain of medical marijuana sold in West Hollywood, and which originates in Seth's Mind's Eye. Over time, the format expanded to include rodeo bulls, world-champion pogoists, and gay porn actors.

The aim of this project is to replicate this game in web format.
